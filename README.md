# Usage process:
- Step 1: Download all files from this repo using `git clone https://github.com/SpikyGames1/discord-bot-gui.git` if you have git, otherwise download the zip folder from GitHub itself
- Step 2: Extract the zip folder wherever you want idk
- Step 3: Go to the terminal (üò±) and navigate to the extracted folder, and install the packages `flask` & `flask_cors` using `py -m pip install flask flask_cors` (for Windows) OR `pip install flask flask_cors` (for UNIX-based OSes like Linux, Mac, BSD, etc.)
- Step 4: Run the `server.py` file using whichever code editor/terminal you use
- Step 5: WHILE THE PYTHON SCRIPT IS RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND, navigate to `localhost:5000` in your browser.
- Step 6: Put the bot token in the text and click login and wait for a few moments depending on how good your internet is
- Step 7: Once you're in the dashboard, wait for a few more seconds and wait for the servers to load.
- Step 8: Use it like the way you use normal discord I guess?


# Advantages:
Possibly none. But you can delete messages on servers you have the permission to delete messages wowowowowwowowow (it'll say failed to delete message but it actually does delete the message in actual discord so don't worry)


# Goodbye
Have an amazing rest of your day!
